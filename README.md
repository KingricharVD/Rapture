Rapture Core
=============

https://our-rapture.com

Rapture digital currency is a highly secure and flexible method of payment that furthers the economic strength of the community itself. With no connection to the manipulation and corruption of the global banking and financial cartels, Rapture provides a way for believers to store value, exchange value, transact, and spread the word to the masses. 

Rapture has three core goals:

• To provide secure blockchain technology leveraged by believers

• To create a built-in market for tract and gift sales, which gives believes a platform for spreading their message while increasing value to the currency

• To serve as a convenient method of payment among believers, which increases the community grant fund for outreach and missionary programs

Masternodes
-----------
Rapture implements masternodes that provide serveral important functions to the network. For the network services they provide, a random Masternode on the network is selected for each block and awarded 50% of the block subsidy.

Masternodes MUST be run on a separate server with a hot/cold wallet setup. Most users will opt to use a VPS service with an Ubuntu 16.04 server such as Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Compute, or Vultr. Masternodes can not be operated from a local wallet as it is unsecure and a liability to have an unlocked and unecrypted local wallet...therfore, this functionality is blocked at a source code level.

Masternodes also require sentinel ( https://github.com/RaptureCore/sentinel ) and the installation instructions found in that repository must be followed to host a properly functioning Masternode.
