Rapture Core
=============

https://our-rapture.com

Rapture digital currency is a highly secure and flexible method of payment that furthers the economic strength of the community itself. With no connection to the manipulation and corruption of the global banking and financial cartels, Rapture provides a way for believers to store value, exchange value, transact, and spread the word to the masses. 

Rapture has three core goals:

• To provide secure blockchain technology leveraged by believers

• To create a built-in market for tract and gift sales, which gives believes a platform for spreading their message while increasing value to the currency

• To serve as a convenient method of payment among believers, which increases the community grant fund for outreach and missionary programs
